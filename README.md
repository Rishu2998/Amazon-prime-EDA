# Amazon-prime-EDA
Introduction

In today's competitive streaming industry, platforms like Amazon Prime Video are constantly expanding their content libraries to cater to diverse audiences. With a growing number of shows and movies available on the platform, data-driven insights play a crucial role in understanding trends, audience preferences, and content strategy. This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Prime's dataset, which includes TV shows and movies. The goal is to extract insights about content distribution, genre popularity, key contributors, and trends over time, which can help in strategic decision-making regarding content acquisition and recommendations.

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of two main files:

titles.csv – Contains metadata about movies and TV shows, including title, genre, release year, IMDB ratings etc.

By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights into content trends, most popular genres, audience preferences, and key contributors driving Amazon Prime’s success.
